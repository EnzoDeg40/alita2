# Alita2

The goal of this old project is to create a voice assistant, similar to Neuro Sama, capable of providing oral responses like an AI, while also performing basic actions like Google Assistant. Additionally, the project aims to enable the assistant to learn without requiring fine-tuning (as I do not have the necessary resources), but rather by using a database.

Install:
```
make
```

Run:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
